PR #2476 by @tiangolo . 0.62.0 \u00b6 Features \u00b6 \u2728 Add support for shared/top-level parameters (dependencies, tags, etc). PR #2434 by @tiangolo . Up to now, for several options, the only way to apply them to a group of path operations was in include_router . That works well, but the call to app.include_router() or router.include_router() is normally done in another file. That means that, for example, to apply authentication to all the path operations in a router it would end up being done in a different file, instead of keeping related logic together. Setting options in include_router still makes sense in some cases, for example, to override or increase configurations from a third party router included in an app. But in a router that is part of a bigger application, it would probably make more sense to add those settings when creating the APIRouter . In FastAPI This allows setting the (mostly new) parameters (additionally to the already existing parameters): default_response_class : updated to handle defaults in APIRouter and include_router . dependencies : to include \u2728 top-level dependencies \u2728 that apply to the whole application. E.g. to add global authentication. callbacks : OpenAPI callbacks that apply to all the path operations . deprecated : to mark all the path operations as deprecated. \ud83e\udd37 include_in_schema : to allow excluding all the path operations from the OpenAPI schema. responses : OpenAPI responses that apply to all the path operations . For example: from fastapi import FastAPI , Depends async def some_dependency (): return app = FastAPI ( dependencies = [ Depends ( some_dependency )]) In APIRouter This allows setting the (mostly new) parameters (additionally to the already existing parameters): default_response_class : updated to handle defaults in APIRouter and include_router . For example, it's not needed to set it explicitly when creating callbacks . dependencies : to include \u2728 router-level dependencies \u2728 that apply to all the path operations in a router. Up to now, this was only possible with include_router . callbacks : OpenAPI callbacks that apply to all the path operations in this router. deprecated : to mark all the path operations in a router as deprecated. include_in_schema : to allow excluding all the path operations in a router from the OpenAPI schema. responses : OpenAPI responses that apply to all the path operations in a router. prefix : to set the path prefix for a router. Up to now, this was only possible when calling include_router . tags : OpenAPI tags to apply to all the path operations in this router. For example: from fastapi import APIRouter , Depends async def some_dependency (): return router = APIRouter ( prefix = \"/users\" , dependencies = [ Depends ( some_dependency )]) In include_router Most of these settings are now supported in APIRouter , which normally lives closer to the related code, so it is recommended to use APIRouter when possible. But include_router is still useful to, for example, adding options (like dependencies , prefix , and tags ) when including a third party router, or a generic router that is shared between several projects. This PR allows setting the (mostly new) parameters (additionally to the already existing parameters): default_response_class : updated to handle defaults in APIRouter and FastAPI . deprecated : to mark all the path operations in a router as deprecated in OpenAPI. include_in_schema : to allow disabling all the path operations from showing in the OpenAPI schema. callbacks : OpenAPI callbacks that apply to all the path operations in this router. Note: all the previous parameters are still there, so it's still possible to declare dependencies in include_router . Breaking Changes \u00b6 PR #2434 includes several improvements that shouldn't affect normal use cases, but could affect in advanced scenarios: If you are testing the generated OpenAPI (you shouldn't, FastAPI already tests it extensively for you): the order for tags in include_router and path operations was updated for consistency, but it's a simple order change. If you have advanced custom logic to access each route's route.response_class , or the router.default_response_class , or the app.default_response_class : the default value for response_class in APIRoute and for default_response_class in APIRouter and FastAPI is now a DefaultPlaceholder used internally to handle and solve default values and overrides. The actual response class inside the DefaultPlaceholder is available at route.response_class.value .

Fix OpenAPI/JSON Schema generation for two functions with the same name (in different modules) with the same composite bodies. Composite bodies' IDs are now based on path, not only on route name, as the auto-generated name uses the function names, that can be duplicated in different modules. The same new ID generation applies to response models. This also changes the generated title for those models. Only composite bodies and response models are affected because those are generated dynamically, they don't have a module (a Python file). This also adds the possibility of using .include_router() with the same APIRouter multiple times, with different prefixes, e.g. /api/v2 and /api/latest , and it will now work correctly.

PR #331 by @mariacamilagl . Add SQLite online viewers to the docs . PR #330 by @cyrilbois . 0.30.0 \u00b6 Add support for Pydantic's ORM mode: Updated documentation about SQL with SQLAlchemy, using Pydantic models with ORM mode, SQLAlchemy models with relations, separation of files, simplification of code and other changes. New docs: SQL (Relational) Databases . The new support for ORM mode fixes issues/adds features related to ORMs with lazy-loading, hybrid properties, dynamic/getters (using @property decorators) and several other use cases. This applies to ORMs like SQLAlchemy, Peewee, Tortoise ORM, GINO ORM and virtually any other. If your path operations return an arbitrary object with attributes (e.g. my_item.name instead of my_item[\"name\"] ) AND you use a response_model , make sure to update the Pydantic models with orm_mode = True as described in the docs (link above). New documentation about receiving plain dict s as request bodies: Bodies of arbitrary dict s . New documentation about returning arbitrary dict s in responses: Response with arbitrary dict . Technical Details : When declaring a response_model it is used directly to generate the response content, from whatever was returned from the path operation function . Before this, the return content was first passed through jsonable_encoder to ensure it was a \"jsonable\" object, like a dict , instead of an arbitrary object with attributes (like an ORM model). That's why you should make sure to update your Pydantic models for objects with attributes to use orm_mode = True . If you don't have a response_model , the return object will still be passed through jsonable_encoder first. When a response_model is declared, the same response_model type declaration won't be used as is, it will be \"cloned\" to create an new one (a cloned Pydantic Field with all the submodels cloned as well). This avoids/fixes a potential security issue: as the returned object is passed directly to Pydantic, if the returned object was a subclass of the response_model (e.g. you return a UserInDB that inherits from User but contains extra fields, like hashed_password , and User is used in the response_model ), it would still pass the validation (because UserInDB is a subclass of User ) and the object would be returned as-is, including the hashed_password . To fix this, the declared response_model is cloned, if it is a Pydantic model class (or contains Pydantic model classes in it, e.g. in a List[Item] ), the Pydantic model class(es) will be a different one (the \"cloned\" one). So, an object that is a subclass won't simply pass the validation and returned as-is, because it is no longer a sub-class of the cloned response_model . Instead, a new Pydantic model object will be created with the contents of the returned object. So, it will be a new object (made with the data from the returned one), and will be filtered by the cloned response_model , containing only the declared fields as normally. PR #322 .

This avoids calling each dependency multiple times for the same request. This is useful while calling external services, performing costly computation, etc. This also means that if a dependency was declared as a path operation decorator dependency, possibly at the router level (with .include_router() ) and then it is declared again in a specific path operation , the dependency will be called only once.

This allows having delegated authentication in the Swagger UI docs. For this to work, you need to add {your_origin}/docs/oauth2-redirect to the allowed callbacks in your OAuth2 provider (in Auth0, Facebook, Google, etc). For example, during development, it could be http://localhost:8000/docs/oauth2-redirect . Have in mind that this callback URL is independent of whichever one is used by your frontend. You might also have another callback at https://yourdomain.com/login/callback . This is only to allow delegated authentication in the API docs with Swagger UI. PR #198 by @steinitzu .

A parameter in the .include_router() method of FastAPI applications and routers, to include dependencies that should be executed in each path operation in a router. This is useful, for example, to require authentication or permissions in specific group of path operations . Different dependencies can be applied to different routers. These dependencies are run before the normal parameter dependencies. And normal dependencies are run too. They can be combined. Dependencies declared in a router are executed first, then the ones defined in path operation decorators , and then the ones declared in normal parameters. They are all combined and executed.

PR #2434 by @tiangolo . Up to now, for several options, the only way to apply them to a group of path operations was in include_router . That works well, but the call to app.include_router() or router.include_router() is normally done in another file. That means that, for example, to apply authentication to all the path operations in a router it would end up being done in a different file, instead of keeping related logic together. Setting options in include_router still makes sense in some cases, for example, to override or increase configurations from a third party router included in an app. But in a router that is part of a bigger application, it would probably make more sense to add those settings when creating the APIRouter . In FastAPI This allows setting the (mostly new) parameters (additionally to the already existing parameters): default_response_class : updated to handle defaults in APIRouter and include_router . dependencies : to include \u2728 top-level dependencies \u2728 that apply to the whole application. E.g. to add global authentication. callbacks : OpenAPI callbacks that apply to all the path operations . deprecated : to mark all the path operations as deprecated. \ud83e\udd37 include_in_schema : to allow excluding all the path operations from the OpenAPI schema. responses : OpenAPI responses that apply to all the path operations . For example: from fastapi import FastAPI , Depends async def some_dependency (): return app = FastAPI ( dependencies = [ Depends ( some_dependency )]) In APIRouter This allows setting the (mostly new) parameters (additionally to the already existing parameters): default_response_class : updated to handle defaults in APIRouter and include_router . For example, it's not needed to set it explicitly when creating callbacks . dependencies : to include \u2728 router-level dependencies \u2728 that apply to all the path operations in a router. Up to now, this was only possible with include_router . callbacks : OpenAPI callbacks that apply to all the path operations in this router. deprecated : to mark all the path operations in a router as deprecated. include_in_schema : to allow excluding all the path operations in a router from the OpenAPI schema. responses : OpenAPI responses that apply to all the path operations in a router. prefix : to set the path prefix for a router. Up to now, this was only possible when calling include_router . tags : OpenAPI tags to apply to all the path operations in this router. For example: from fastapi import APIRouter , Depends async def some_dependency (): return router = APIRouter ( prefix = \"/users\" , dependencies = [ Depends ( some_dependency )]) In include_router Most of these settings are now supported in APIRouter , which normally lives closer to the related code, so it is recommended to use APIRouter when possible. But include_router is still useful to, for example, adding options (like dependencies , prefix , and tags ) when including a third party router, or a generic router that is shared between several projects. This PR allows setting the (mostly new) parameters (additionally to the already existing parameters): default_response_class : updated to handle defaults in APIRouter and FastAPI . deprecated : to mark all the path operations in a router as deprecated in OpenAPI. include_in_schema : to allow disabling all the path operations from showing in the OpenAPI schema. callbacks : OpenAPI callbacks that apply to all the path operations in this router.

If you have advanced custom logic to access each route's route.response_class , or the router.default_response_class , or the app.default_response_class : the default value for response_class in APIRoute and for default_response_class in APIRouter and FastAPI is now a DefaultPlaceholder used internally to handle and solve default values and overrides.

New docs: SQL (Relational) Databases . The new support for ORM mode fixes issues/adds features related to ORMs with lazy-loading, hybrid properties, dynamic/getters (using @property decorators) and several other use cases. This applies to ORMs like SQLAlchemy, Peewee, Tortoise ORM, GINO ORM and virtually any other. If your path operations return an arbitrary object with attributes (e.g. my_item.name instead of my_item[\"name\"] ) AND you use a response_model , make sure to update the Pydantic models with orm_mode = True as described in the docs (link above). New documentation about receiving plain dict s as request bodies: Bodies of arbitrary dict s . New documentation about returning arbitrary dict s in responses: Response with arbitrary dict . Technical Details : When declaring a response_model it is used directly to generate the response content, from whatever was returned from the path operation function . Before this, the return content was first passed through jsonable_encoder to ensure it was a \"jsonable\" object, like a dict , instead of an arbitrary object with attributes (like an ORM model). That's why you should make sure to update your Pydantic models for objects with attributes to use orm_mode = True . If you don't have a response_model , the return object will still be passed through jsonable_encoder first. When a response_model is declared, the same response_model type declaration won't be used as is, it will be \"cloned\" to create an new one (a cloned Pydantic Field with all the submodels cloned as well). This avoids/fixes a potential security issue: as the returned object is passed directly to Pydantic, if the returned object was a subclass of the response_model (e.g. you return a UserInDB that inherits from User but contains extra fields, like hashed_password , and User is used in the response_model ), it would still pass the validation (because UserInDB is a subclass of User ) and the object would be returned as-is, including the hashed_password . To fix this, the declared response_model is cloned, if it is a Pydantic model class (or contains Pydantic model classes in it, e.g. in a List[Item] ), the Pydantic model class(es) will be a different one (the \"cloned\" one). So, an object that is a subclass won't simply pass the validation and returned as-is, because it is no longer a sub-class of the cloned response_model . Instead, a new Pydantic model object will be created with the contents of the returned object. So, it will be a new object (made with the data from the returned one), and will be filtered by the cloned response_model , containing only the declared fields as normally. PR #322 .
