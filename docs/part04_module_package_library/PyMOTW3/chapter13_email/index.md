Email is one of the oldest forms of digital communication, but it is still one of the most popular. Python’s standard library includes modules for sending, receiving, and storing email messages.

smtplib communicates with a mail server to deliver a message. smtpd can be used to create a custom mail server, and provides classes useful for debugging email transmission in other applications.

imaplib uses the IMAP protocol to manipulate messages stored on a server. It provides a low-level API for IMAP clients, and can query, retrieve, move, and delete messages.

Local message archives can be created and modified with mailbox using several standard formats including the popular mbox and Maildir formats used by many email client programs.
