Python does not include native types for dates and times as it does for int, float, and str, but there are three modules for manipulating date and time values in several representations.

The time module exposes the time-related functions from the underlying C library. It includes functions for retrieving the clock time and the processor run time, as well as basic parsing and string formatting tools.

The datetime module provides a higher level interface for date, time, and combined values. The classes in datetime support arithmetic, comparison, and time zone configuration.

The calendar module creates formatted representations of weeks, months, and years. It can also be used to compute recurring events, the day of the week for a given date, and other calendar-based values.
